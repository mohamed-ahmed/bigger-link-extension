bigger-link-extension
=====================

Make text links appear as big as you want. Easier to select when using a touch screen.

Many tablet users run into the problem if clicking small text links on a web page.
This is an extension that increases the size of text links on a web page. Rather than zooming in and making the whole page bigger, making images look pixelated and ruining the page layout, it just increases the size of text links.
